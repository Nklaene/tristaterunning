        <h3>Healthy Clinics & Injury Screens</h3>
        <p>Take advantage of our extensive partnerships with local medical professionals and health experts! Clinics and
            injury screens are regularly conducted by physical therapists, chiropractors, personal trainers, massage
            therapists, podiatrists, nutritionists, and yoga instructors.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: Injury screens are intended to be used as an initial assessment, and are not designed to replace an
            office appointment you may already have scheduled with a medical professional.</p>
