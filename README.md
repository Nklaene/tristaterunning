# tristaterunning
This was my final project for INF 286 at NKU.
The assignment was to find a company's website & design and develop a new one.

I love to run in my free time, so I decided to base my project on tristaterunning.com, a local running shop near me.

Because I am not a designer & this was my first ever large project, it is not the best looking but I believe it shows I am capable of working with Javascript & CSS.
