# tristaterunning
This was my final project for INF 286 at NKU.
We were assigned to find a website to redesign and redevelop

I love to run in my free time, so I decided to base my project on tristaterunning.com
I do not really have an eye for design so this project was very difficult for me
Despite this project being difficult, I think the final project turned out pretty good & shows that I am capable of working on the front end
