# tristaterunning
This was my final project for INF 286 at NKU.
The assignment was to find a company's website & design and develop a new one.

I love to run in my free time, so I decided to base my project on tristaterunning.com, a local running shop near me.
I do not really have an eye for design so this project was surprisingly difficult as I could not decide on how the website should look.
Despite this project being difficult, I think the final project turned out pretty good & shows that I am capable of working on the front end.
